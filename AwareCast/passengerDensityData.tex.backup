\section{Count of persons data}
This section discusses the properties of the recorded datat as well as its suitability for context prediction.
\subsection{Properties of the data}
\label{sec:PassengerDensityData}

In order to model the passenger density an understanding of the available data is necessary. In this section the data, visible pattern and other features are discussed.

Figure~\ref{fig:rawData_week} illustrates exemplary the available values of a camera and week. The PdG service times are visible due to the low passenger density level between 01:00 and 05:00 on weekdays.

The figure details the passenger density data observed by one particular out of the 20 installed CCTV cameras (indexed with ID 700).
