\label{sec:seam4us}

To investigate on energy efficient subsystems (ventilation, escalator, lightning), the EU funded in the Seventh Framework Programme the project "Sustainable Energy mAnageMent for Underground Stations" (SEAM4US). The aim of SEAM4US "is to develop advanced technologies for optimal and scalable control of metro stations [...]".~\cite{SEAM4US_Website}.

In cases where the SEAM4US system performs energy management tasks based on situations taking place in the future, a predictive control architecture is used~\cite{ansuini_models_2013}. The control architecture proactively controls the metro station subsystems under different passenger density and thermal conditions.
To control in a foreseen manner, prediction models are used. Besides others, one prediction model is the user model, which predicts the passengers density in a certain section, on a certain time in the future.

The SEAM4US consortium consists of nine partners from six different EU countries, namely Cofely, UniVPM, UPC, Fraunhofer FIT, VTT, Almende, UniKassel, CNET, and TMB. Each partner supports the consortium within its expertise:

\section{Pilot Station "Passeig de Gr\`{a}cia - Line 3"}
\label{sec:station}

%TODO http://www.tmb.cat/en/detall-linia-metro/-/linia/L3/327

The SEAM4US system is implemented in the line station Passeig de Gr\`{a}cia - Line~3~(PdG-L3), which is a station within TMBs metro network in Barcelona. This section describes the station in detail, while the understanding of a "station" in the context of metro networks is defined first.

In general a metro network consists of one or more metro lines. Each line has a defined railway with a given number of stops to allow passengers to get on or off the trains. Each of these stops is called "line station". In contrast, a "metro station" represents the point in space through which passengers get underground and into a line station. Metro station and line station can be the same physical entity, but it is possible that a metro stations holds more than one line stations.

The metro station Passeig de Gr\`{a}cia~(PdG) lies in the iconic and touristic part of Barcelona. Some popular buildings designed by Antoni Gaud\'{i} (Casa Batll\`{o}, Casa Mil\`{a}) as well as the city's most renown and exclusive boutiques are in the proximity.
The metro station is one of the oldest of the Barcelona metro network. First opened in December 1924, as station for Line~3~(L3), nowadays PdG holds three different line stations: Line~2, Line~3, and Line~4. The line stations were built in three different periods, using different construction technologies. All line stations have been refurbished a few times since 1924, and new equipment has been added recently. Figure~\ref{fig:PdG_entranceExit} depicts an entrance/exit of metro station Passeig de Gr\`{a}cia.

  \label{fig:PdG_entranceExit}
\end{figure}

Depending on the weekday PdG is open 19~hours, 21~hours, or 24~hours. Between Monday and Thursday PdG service starts at 5:00 and ends at 24:00 (19~hours). Friday service starts at 5:00 and ends at 2:00 (21~hours). On Saturday service starts at 5:00 too but remain the entire night and day until Sunday midnight.

As pilot station for the SEAM4US system Passeig~de~Gr\`{a}cia - Line~3~(PdG-L3) was selected since it turns out to be representative for many station within TMBs metro network~\cite{TMB_2014}. The count of fans, escalators, and the platform schema is comparable to other stations. Moreover, PdG-L3 is a crowded station which have low-rate usage hours as well. Therefore a wide range of data are available, that allows to test with very busy peak hours as well as with off-peaks.


\subsection{Spaces}
\label{subsec:PdG-L3_spaces}

The line station PdG-L3 consists of private (staff only) and public spaces. Private spaces such as technical rooms or staff dependencies are not part of the investigation of the SEAM4US project. Public spaces, such as halls, transit areas, accesses to the platforms, and platforms are, however, in the focus.

Essential part of (every) line station are the platforms, which allow passengers to leave and enter trains. PdG-L3 laid out on a PRRP schema - Platform-Rail-Rail-Platform. The PdG-L3 platforms are depicted on Figure~\ref{fig:PdG-L3_platforms}. To leave the platforms, several escalators are available. Figure~\ref{fig:PdG-L3_escalator} depicts exemplarily an escalator.

\subsection{CCTV System}
\label{subsec:CCTVSystem}

Throughout the station a Closed Circuit Television~(CCTV) surveillance system is installed. 20~CCTV~cameras provide images for security reasons. Figure~\ref{fig:PdG-L3_CCTVcameras} show exemplary CCTV cameras on the platform~(Figure~\ref{fig:PdG-L3_CCTVcamera_transitArea}) as well as in the transit area~(Figure~\ref{fig:PdG-L3_CCTVcamera_transitArea}).

The CCTV System provides valuable information for the SEAM4US system, which is explained in the following section.


\section{Passenger density data extraction}
\label{sec:PassengerDensityDataExtraction}

The SEAM4US system uses prediction model for proactively controlling the subsystems - as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:seam4us}. Besides others, the passenger density model is a part of the predictive controlling architecture.
To predict passenger densities for a point in future, the model utilizes the output from the CCTV monitoring. In order to extract the passenger density within the station, the CCTV~system is enhanced with image processing.

Whenever camera pictures are processed privacy issues are tackled. In order to ensure the passengers privacy several design constraints where defined:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item All CCTV images are processed within the station.
  \item All CCTV images are processed "on the fly". For the purpose of passenger density extraction, no CCTV image is saved.
  \item The image processing is performed on a separate computer, which is not connected to other TMB Systems and is only accessible via a dedicated VPN connection.
  \item The image processing works without human interaction.
  \item The image data are filtered to avoid recognisability of individuals.
  \item The image processing results are transmitting only in terms of integer numbers to the database.
\end{enumerate}

With respect to these design constraints, the passenger density extraction was implemented. The workflow is described briefly in the following.

First, the video streams coming from all cameras are combined into one single video stream by a video recorder. This video recorder creates a carousel video composed of sections for the individual camera appearing in a predefined order. The duration of the camera sections is set to 3~seconds. With 20~cameras and 3~seconds hold on each, one turn of the carousel is completed in about one minute.

The video recorder is connected to the local computer and transfer the images subsequently. On the local computer, the density estimator processes the transferred images and extracts the passenger density.

The density estimator algorithm uses a combination of edge detection and background subtraction. In the  following, the algorithm is described briefly.
First the algorithm separates background and foreground. Followed by creating the foreground mask.
Through filtering the edges of the foreground only are extracted. The foreground edges are combined with the foreground mask. Finally, the result is refined by dilating (and then eroding) the segmented the blobs. %TODO reference ?Almende?
%In parallel to the process described above, we detect the edge of the whole image by applying the Canny edge detection on the three RGB channels of the original image; the results acquired the different channels are then combined via a simple logic OR. Eventually, the intersection of this image with the dilated foreground mask  (obtained using a logic AND) allows us to extract the edges of the foreground only (see Figure 13). 
%"The last step of the crowd density detection algorithm consists in combining this last image with the foreground mask via a logic OR and to refine the result by dilating (and then eroding) the segmented the blobs."  
%All parts have been developed using the C++ OpenCV libraries.
For different reasons, e.g. occluded or damaged camera, it is possible that the passenger density algorithm fails. In this cases, the algorithm returns the error value "-1".

The extracted passenger density as well as date, time and the camera-ID of the image are transmitted to the database. The general approach is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:CCTVimageProcessing}.

\end{figure}

The CCTV and image processing runs 24~hours, 7~days a week. Each day 28800~datasets are transmitted to the database. Overall the database contains 90~days of data. The available data are discussed in the next section.
