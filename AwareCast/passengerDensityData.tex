\section{Passenger density Data}
\label{sec:PassengerDensityData}

In order to model the passenger density an understanding of the available data is necessary. In this section the data, visible pattern and other features are discussed.

Figure~\ref{fig:rawData_week} illustrates exemplary the available values of a camera and week. At a more detailed view Figure~\ref{fig:rawData_day} shows the passenger density level of a camera and (week)day. On both Figures the PdG service times are visible due to the low passenger density level between 01:00 and 05:00 on weekdays.
